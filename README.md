## 1. Setup

First of all, you have to setup `node.js` and `yarn`.
If you have some specific reason, I recommend to install `node` using `nodebrew`.
(https://github.com/hokaccha/nodebrew)

```
nodebrew install v16.3.0
nodebrew use 16
npm install yarn
yarn install
```


## 2. Development

`yarn dev`
